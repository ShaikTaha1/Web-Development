    <h2>Hello and welcome to my blog</h2>
    <p>Here I'm going to share my life journey. I'm Shaik Taha(Software Engineer) hope you all doing well.<br/>
    In this blog I'm going to share you some of the useful tips to the students who are studying engineering or going to persue later on.<br/><br/>
    What to do after engineering hope you all have same questions in your mind. By reading my blog you will able know what are the circumstances you will face while persuing engineering and after engineering many of us know that India is a leading country providing a large quantity of engineers per year.<br/><br/>
    Well as an engineer I can clearly tell you that engineering is a tough job to do there are many students who persue engineering as a superior way to express them self.<br/><br/>
    Engineering is something different as it compare with capita. Because many of us think that engineering is a source of getting a good job or having high income salary.<br/>
    But engineering is beyond your thinking. <br/>
